/// These exist because the transport's failure modes only appear on a live
/// socket: the daemon answers a `Connection: close` request and then hangs up,
/// which `Network` reports as a *failed* connection state (ENETDOWN) rather
/// than a clean end — and often ahead of the last bytes it has already buffered.
/// Treating that state as an error dropped every complete response on the
/// floor, and no amount of parser-level testing would have shown it.
